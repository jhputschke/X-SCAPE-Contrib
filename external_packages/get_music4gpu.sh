# using a commit from the MUSIC repository that is compatible with the current X-SCAPE version
folderName="music4gpu"
# XSCAPE branch with the jet source slot (add_hydro_source_terms_from_jet, which
# MusicWrapper calls since X-SCAPE PR #138), per-step jet droplet pruning, the
# freeze_out_surface switch, and the GPU-path source fill speed-ups (MUSIC4GPU PR #10:
# skip steps where no source can deposit -- HydroSourceJETSCAPE reports the jet side
# since X-SCAPE PR #144 -- and bin the strings by transverse reach; output bit-identical),
# and StringFind4 failing loudly on a parameter file without EndOfData instead of
# hanging (MUSIC4GPU PR #11), the parallel, deterministic freeze-out surface search
# (MUSIC4GPU PR #12), and the GPU fix for grids freezing in dilute regions: vacuum
# cells at rest, a guard against non-finite W^{mu nu}/Pi with a counter and warning
# (MUSIC_ABORT_ON_NONFINITE=1 stops instead), see MUSIC4GPU docs/VacReset_BUG.md (PR #13),
# the in-memory evolution store releasing its memory when an event is cleaned
# instead of keeping its largest size for the whole run (MUSIC4GPU PR #15),
# and less host CPU per event (MUSIC4GPU PR #18): MUSIC_CUDA_SYNC=block|yield|spin|auto
# selects how the host waits for the GPU (unset keeps CUDA's default), and the string
# source computes per-string constants once per step and skips zero envelopes and,
# without preflow, the transverse-flow terms (output bit-identical)
